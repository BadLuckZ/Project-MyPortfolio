      <br>This project started in May 2025 and it took me around 2 weeks to do since I was an intern.</b>
      <br><br>
      The project has a responsive design, so it works well on phones, 
      tablets, and computers. I made it simple and easy to use, so I can focus on 
      learning and remembering words without any distractions.
      <br><br> This project contains 3 parts
      <dd>1. <b>EntryPage</b> which is the first page. It gives a simple welcome and lets users start the learning experience.</dd>
      <dd>2. <b>CategoryPage</b> which shows different vocabulary decks grouped by topics like Business, Travel, or Daily Life. 
      Users can pick the deck they want to study. Furthermore, users can rename decks or remove unused decks.</dd>
      <dd>3. <b>DeckPage</b> which displays flashcards from the selected deck. 
      At the front of each card, it shows a word and its type. On the other side, it shows its meaning and a sample sentence. 
      Cards can be flipped and browsed through.Furthermore, users can adjust card's information and remove cards from the deck.</dd>

      1. <b>This is my first time making a full personal project by 
      myself in a short amount of time.</b>
      <br>
      I planned everything on my own â€” from the design to the features. 
      It took a lot of time to design since I wasnâ€™t very good at it (still not great ðŸ˜”). 
      <br>
      Because of the short timeline, I had to manage my time carefully to finish everything.
      <br>
      In the end, the design is fine for me and its functionality went well, 
      and I think this helped me improve at building and completing real projects.

      2. <b>I can create a responsive and user-friendly website.</b>
      <br>
      This project made me take on 3 roles: Designer, Developer, and User. 
      I had to think about how the app looks, how it works, and how it feels to use.
      <br>
      Doing all of this helped me understand how important it is to make a website that is both 
      functional and easy to use on any device.

    learn: `There are 2 things I can learn by doing this project
      <br><br>
      <dd>
        1. <b>Iâ€™ve learned the challenges and hardships of game development.</b>
        <br>
        Iâ€™ve always had questions about game development-for example, 
        why do so many games Iâ€™ve played have bugs? Why arenâ€™t they thoroughly tested before release? 
        However, after working on this project with my friend, I understood why these situations happen.
        We tried to play our game as much as we can to solve the bugs inside the project and when our time 
        to present the project came, it still had bugs in our project.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dd>
        2. <b>This is my first chance to code with my friend. 
        I thought it wouldn't be that hard but it's not like that.</b>
        <br>
        Although our communication went well, many functions we wanted to code were harder 
        than we thought due to our lack of experience and knowledge. So we decided to code 
        the main features first such as movement systems
        and animations. When we had some time, we learned how to code things we wanted and applied to our projects.
        That situation improves our coding skills.
      </dd>`,
    contribution: `<b>The parts I contributed to this project are as follows...</b>
      <br><br>
      <dd>
        1. <b>Player Movement</b><br> I coded the basic movement system for the player (left-right movement) 
        and setting up the camera border to follow the player's position dynamically.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dd>
        2. <b>Damage Calculation</b><br> I designed the system for calculating various types of damage for 
        both the player and monsters. This allows for a variety of damage outputs, with each attack
        producing different damage values. 
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dd>
        3. <b>Perk System</b><br> I implemented the abilities of different perks, 
        as well as the systems for purchasing and upgrading them.  
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dd>
        4. <b>SFX</b><br> I was responsible for selecting the music and sound effects 
        used throughout the game.
      </dd>
      <br>
      Additionally, I also assisted my partner in some aspects of this project. For example, 
      I contributed to defining the stats for both the player and monsters, designing 
      and creating various in-game scenes, and writing this project's sdocumentation.
